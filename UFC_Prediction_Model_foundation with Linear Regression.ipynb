        "# UFC Fight Prediction Model\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook details the development of a machine learning model to predict the outcomes of UFC fights. The model utilizes historical fighter data, including physical attributes, fight statistics, and average performance metrics, to forecast the winner of a bout.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Source\n",
        "\n",
        "The model was trained using the \"UFC Dataset 2024\" available on Kaggle. This dataset provides comprehensive information on UFC fighters, events, and fight statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Kaggle Dataset Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thasankakandage/ufc-dataset-2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thasankakandage/ufc-dataset-2024)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Model Development Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "The following high-level steps were undertaken to create the prediction model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Acquisition:** UFC datasets were downloaded and loaded, containing information on fighter profiles, fight statistics, and event details.\n",
        "2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The datasets were cleaned by handling missing values, converting data types, and calculating new features like fighter age and win-loss ratio.\n",
        "3. **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features were selected and engineered to enhance the predictive power of the model.\n",
        "4. **Data Splitting:** The data was split into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.\n",
        "5. **Model Selection and Training:** A Logistic Regression model was chosen for its suitability for binary classification tasks. The model was trained using a pipeline that incorporated data preprocessing steps like standardization.\n",
        "6. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix was also generated to analyze the types of prediction errors.\n",
        "7. **Prediction and Visualization:** The model was used to predict the outcomes of hypothetical fights, and the results were visualized to understand the predicted winners and their associated probabilities. Feature importance was also visualized to identify the most influential factors in the predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Model Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "The core of the prediction model is a Logistic Regression classifier. This algorithm is well-suited for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes (in this case, whether a fighter wins or loses). The model learns the relationships between the input features (fighter attributes, fight statistics, etc.) and the probability of winning a fight. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies patterns and trends that contribute to a fighter's success.\n",

        "\n",
        "The following features were identified as the most important in predicting fight outcomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Average Significant Strikes Landed:**  Fighters who land more significant strikes on average tend to have a higher probability of winning.\n",
        "2.  **Opponent's Average Losses:**  Facing an opponent with a higher number of losses increases the fighter's chances of winning.\n",
        "3.  **Fighter's Age:**  Age plays a role in fight outcomes, although the specific relationship (whether younger or older fighters are favored) depends on the model's coefficients.\n",
        "4.  **Fighter's Height:** Taller fighters may have an advantage in certain situations.\n",
        "5.  **Fighter's Weight:** Weight can be a factor, potentially indicating strength or power differences.\n",
        "6.  **... (Include other important features and their interpretations) ...**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Model Improvement\n",
        "\n",
        "The current model provides a good foundation for UFC fight prediction, but there are several avenues for improvement:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Incorporate More Data:**  Including additional data sources, such as fight narratives, judges' scores, and opponent-specific statistics, could enhance the model's accuracy.\n",
        "* **Feature Engineering:** Explore more sophisticated feature engineering techniques, such as creating interaction terms between features or incorporating domain expertise to craft more meaningful predictors.\n",
        "* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize the model's hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength) to fine-tune its performance.\n",
        "* **Ensemble Methods:**  Consider using ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) to combine multiple models and potentially improve prediction accuracy.\n",
        "* **Address Class Imbalance:** If there is a significant imbalance between wins and losses in the dataset, techniques like oversampling or undersampling can be employed to improve the model's ability to predict both outcomes effectively.\n",
        "* **Consider Alternative Models:**  Experiment with other machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines or Neural Networks, to explore if they can capture more complex relationships in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "By incorporating these improvements, the UFC fight prediction model can be further refined to provide more accurate and insightful predictions."

        "\n",
        "The two charts provide valuable insights into the performance and behavior of the UFC fight prediction model:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Predicted Fight Outcomes Chart**\n",
        "\n",
        "This chart displays the predicted outcomes for specific fights, along with the model's confidence in each prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Predicted Winners:**  The chart clearly indicates the predicted winner for each fight. For example, in a fight between \"Jon Jones\" and \"Stipe Miocic,\" if the bar is longer towards the right and \"Jon Jones\" is displayed within the bar, it means the model predicts Jon Jones as the winner.\n",
        "* **Probability of Winning:** The length of the bar represents the probability assigned to the predicted outcome. A longer bar indicates higher confidence in the prediction. For instance, if the bar for \"Jon Jones vs Stipe Miocic\" extends to 0.8, it means the model predicts Jon Jones to win with an 80% probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Top 10 Feature Importances Chart**\n",
        "\n",
        "This chart highlights the top 10 features that have the most significant impact on the model's predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Key Predictive Factors:** The features at the top of the chart are the most influential in determining the fight outcomes. For example, if \"avg_sig_strikes\" (average significant strikes landed) is at the top with a high positive importance value, it suggests that fighters who land more significant strikes are more likely to win according to the model.\n",
        "* **Interpreting Importance Values:** The direction and magnitude of the importance values indicate how each feature influences the prediction. A positive value suggests that higher values of the feature contribute to a win, while a negative value suggests the opposite. The absolute value of the importance reflects the strength of the feature's influence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overall Insights**\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these charts provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictions and the underlying factors driving those predictions. They help to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Assess Model Confidence:**  Identify predictions with high confidence (long bars in the first chart) and those with more uncertainty (shorter bars).\n",
        "* **Understand Key Drivers:**  Determine the most important fighter attributes and statistics that contribute to winning fights according to the model.\n",
        "* **Gain Actionable Insights:**  Potentially use the insights to make more informed decisions (e.g., in fantasy sports, betting, or even training strategies)."
